        Howdy 👋🏽, I&apos;m Victor. Nice to meet you!{" "}

          I'm a software developer and I love building things. Currently looking
          for <span className="text-primary">backend developer role.</span> I'm
          an explorer by nature so I have lots of interests both in tech and
          otherwise. I'm a musician; I play the guitar, bass guitar and a little
          bit of piano. I also love chess and sports.
